# EXPLAINATION
#Consider the following input line:
#insert 1 10
#So s is the list ["insert", "1", "10"]. Note that the list elements are all strings.
#So cmd is "insert" and args is ["1", "10"].
#Now here's the part that you didn't understand. First, ",".join(args) just creates a single string composed of the elements of arg, separated by commas: "1,10".
#This is then wrapped in parentheses: "(1,10)". Finally, it is appended to cmd resulting in the string "insert(1,10)".
#It then prepends "l." to this, resulting in the string "l.insert(1,10)". This is then passed to eval.
#So it's invoking the insert method on the list l, inserting the value 10 at position 1. I.e., it's executing l.insert(1,10).
